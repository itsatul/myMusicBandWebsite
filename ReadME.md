# SEEED Band Website Project

Welcome to the SEEED Band Website â€” a project created to refresh and strengthen essential web development skills by building a fully functional and visually engaging music band website using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

This site celebrates the Berlin-based music group SEEED, featuring their upcoming tours, an about page describing the band's history, and an interactive store for buying music albums and merchandise.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Purpose

The primary goals of this project are:

- **Reinforce Front-End Fundamentals**: Practice and apply HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript DOM manipulation techniques.
- **Responsive Web Design**: Structure and style a real-world themed website for a music band.
- **Interactive Features**: Implement cart functionality in the store section using JavaScript event handling and DOM updates.
- **Good Code Organization**: Follow best practices for file structuring and linking assets (CSS, JavaScript, images).

This project simulates a simple real-world client request: "Build a mini online presence for a band, including an About page, Store, and Tour information."
